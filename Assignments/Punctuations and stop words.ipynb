furthermore virtue natural connection concomitance parts lord resurrection dead mutually joined body exists species wine blood exists species bread soul exists species bread wine the divinity account admirable hypostatic union body soul similarly exists alike species wherefore species species contained for entire christ exists species bread particle species entire christ exists species wine

purified 11a ii let hear scripture respect holy sacrament 1 i living bread came heaven if man eat bread shall live bread i flesh i life world the jews strove saying how man flesh eat then jesus said unto verily verily i unto except ye eat flesh son man drink blood ye life whoso eateth flesh drinketh blood hath eternal life i raise day for flesh meat blood drink he eateth flesh drinketh blood dwelleth i himthese sayings said synagogue taught capernaum many disciples heard said this hard saying hear when jesus knew disciples murmured said unto doth offend what ye shall son man ascend it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you are spirit and life 11b when lord enforced necessity eating flesh drinking blood jews disciples understanding literally romish clergy expound language murmured hard saying asked possibly men flesh eat whereupon christ avowed way explanation immediately declared words spake spirit flesh profiteth clearly according distinct explanation words understood spiritually figuratively carnally literally 2 as eating jesus took bread blessed brake gave disciples said take eat body and took cup gave thanks gave saying drink ye blood new testament shed remission sins but i unto i drink henceforth this fruit of the vine day i drink new fathers kingdom 12a 1 the authoritative interpretation language employed lord given capernaum his words understood spiritually figuratively declared vine disciples branches 12b accordingly consecration romish clergy assert wine literally transubstantiated actual material blood christ calls fruit vine appellation receive scriptural truth doctrine transubstantiation clearly false erroneous inaccurate 2 we note apostles expressed surprise uttered smallest murmur account lords phraseology instituted sacrament eucharist the reason obvious fact highly worth special attention they heard recollected explanation parallel language employed capernaum hence matter course understood speak figuratively literally natural result words gave no offence 3 i received lord i delivered unto the lord jesus night betrayed took bread given thanks brake said take eat body broken remembrance after manner cup supped saying this cup new testament blood ye oft ye drink remembrance for ye eat this bread drink this cup ye shew lords death till come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread drink this cup lord unworthily shall guilty body blood lord but let man examine let eat the bread drink the cup 13a 1 the language st paul exactly corresponds language christ even consecration apostle observe repeatedly calls elements bread cup bread cup yet truly called transubstantiation literal human flesh literal human blood 2 we note true doctrine eucharist undoubtedly delivered st paul gentile converts corinth appear excited surprise offence whence presumption certainty delivering distinctly taught authority lord master spirit quickeneth flesh profiteth words
